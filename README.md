# Project3_WebsiteBlocker

This is the 3rd project in the Python Mega Course on Udemy. I created a simple website blocker. I also build a 
simple GUI that has 2 simple button "Block" and "Unblock" to illustrate that the program can be further modified and 
improved for different purposes. I tried to add the timing option to the GUI but it stuck in the while loop and 
caused the entire program to stop working. I think it's enough for MÃ¹ng 1 of 2021. Happy Lunar New Year!!!

## Prerequisites

It works by redirecting specific websites to the loopback ip address (172.0.0.1) which causes browsing error.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run main.py with administrator privilege and configure blocking time

To use the GUI version of the code, run GUI.py as administrator
