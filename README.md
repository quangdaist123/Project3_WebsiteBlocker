# Project3_WebsiteBlocker
This is the 3rd project in the Python Mega Course on Udemy. I created a simple website blocker. It works by redirecting specific websites to the loopback ip address (172.0.0.1) which causes browsing error. I also build a simple GUI that has 2 simple button "Block" and "Unblock" to illustrate that the program can be further modified and improved for different purposes. I tried to add the timing option to the GUI but it stuck in the while loop and caused the entire program to stop working. I think it's enough for MÃ¹ng 1 of 2021. Happy Lunar New Year!!!
